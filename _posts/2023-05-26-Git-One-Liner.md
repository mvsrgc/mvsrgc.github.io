# Behold...

This is a great snippet to add to your toolbox when you're working on solo branches.
It's useful when you make a typo or mistake and you want to fix it without having to modify the git message, or create a new commit, or cleanup your git history.

This one-liner stages your changes, amends the last commit while preserving the commit message, and then performs a force push (make sure you are the sole developer on the branch since force pushing overwrites history). VoilÃ ! You're now able to correct any typos effortlessly and quickly fix small mistakes.

I find this particularly valuable when working on CI/CD improvements, as it enables quick iteration and testing. When making changes and repeatedly checking the pipeline for expected outcomes, this command eliminates the need for multiple commits.

I also used it multiple times while configuring this blog, since I wanted to keep a single "First commit" or "First post" commit while configuring the blog and writing the post. As you can see, there's many use cases where this command can be useful.

```sh
git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit && git push -f
```

Add it to your .bashrc:
```sh
echo 'alias gfix="git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit && git push -f"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
